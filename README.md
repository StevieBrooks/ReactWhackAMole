# Educational Whack-a-Mole game (React | TailwindCSS)

This project is being built to help non-native kids improve their knowledge of English nouns. Players will be able to select topics such as food and animals, then choose their desired difficulty level. The game is intended to be fun and useful. 

## Instructions

If you want to jump straight in, just press the Play button and the game will default to the Easiest difficulty rating. Otherwise, hit the menu button and select your topic and difficulty as you wish. 

Once the game begins, listen carefully for the English nouns. If you hear the word "dog" for example, then hit as many dogs as you can see until the next word is called. Keep your eye on the time and keep your ears sharp. Good luck!
